# Ready-to-Go Files (100-Window Version)

This directory contains processed audio files that are ready for the sanity check.

## What's Here

After running `prepare_audio_files.py`, you'll find:

- `isolated_vocal.wav` - Processed vocal (mono, 22050 Hz, 4.7 seconds, normalized)
- `stereo_mixture.wav` - Processed mixture (mono, 22050 Hz, 4.7 seconds, normalized)

## These Files Are

- ✅ Converted to mono
- ✅ Resampled to 22050 Hz
- ✅ Trimmed to exactly 4.7 seconds (100 windows)
- ✅ Normalized
- ✅ Ready for `sanity_check_complete.py`

## Don't Manually Edit

These files are automatically generated by `prepare_audio_files.py`.

If you need to change something, edit your source files in `process/100-window/` and re-run the prepare script.
